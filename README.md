# arc-fixer
A small program to fix Arc in Windows.

## Installation

Go to the releases tab and download the `.bat` file. Open CMD as administrator (not required) and type `cd C:\Users\[YOUR PC USERNAME]\Downloads` or insert your own path to the downloads folder.
Then type `fixArc` and press Enter.

Arc will now work properly.
    
## Support

I don't plan to update this program, but if it doesn't work, be kind enough to open an Issue.
